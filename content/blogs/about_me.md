I am currently completing a Master's in Engineering degree at CentraleSupélec Engineering School (Graduate School of Université Paris-Saclay) and heading towards a Master's in Analytics and Management at the London Business School. 
Dedicated and goal-oriented, I reach my targets through commitment and hard work.
